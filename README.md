# centaur-app

This is a phone app for equestrians to track the training progress of their horse. The app allows riders to track the motion of a ride and uses machine learning (https://github.com/leahnp/centaur) to detect how much time was spent in each "gait" (walk/trot/canter) and the relative rhythm of each gait.  

This was a capstone project for Ada Developers Academy in Seattle, WA. It was presented in August 2016.
